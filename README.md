# Clancy Era |-/

<img height="full" src="https://cdn.campaigns.wmgconnect.com/uploads/header-top.PNG"  />

Clancy Era is a fanmade web page created as a tribute to Twenty One Pilots and their final chapter in the Clancy storyline. This project was born out of admiration for the band's creativity, immersive world-building, and the emotional connection they‚Äôve built with their fans over the years.

The main goal of this site is to celebrate and showcase the Clancy era through videos, lyrics and design inspired by the band‚Äôs official aesthetic. None of the media used here is our own ‚Äî it belongs entirely to Twenty One Pilots, their team, and their respective rights holders. This is a non-commercial, fan-driven tribute built with love and respect for the project.

On a technical note, this page also served as a personal learning playground where I began experimenting with GSAP for scroll-based animations and smooth transitions, as well as Lenis for buttery smooth scrolling. I‚Äôm still learning, and working on this site has helped me grow my skills in front-end animations and UI design.
